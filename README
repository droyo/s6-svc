This is a collection of service directories usable by the s6 supervision suite
for running services under s6.

	http://skarnet.org/software/s6/

These virtual machines use tap networking. For instructions on setting up
a bridge network device suitable for backing virtual 'tap' devices, see

	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Qemu#Tap_networking_with_QEMU

Contained are two service directories to run virtual machines:

vm-use-tapsrv:
	A VM service directory that relies on the `tapsrv` service contained here
	do allocate network devices. Requires ucspi-ipc[0] and aq-utils.

vm-use-finish
	A VM service directory that allocates its own network devices and uses
	the `finish` script to clean them up. This is the simpler of the two solutions.

The more complex `vm-use-tapsrv` service is included for:
	- Educational purposes: simple solution to a common dependency problem
	- Supervision suites that do not have `./finish` functionality, such as the
	  original daemontools.

I have included run scripts in both bourne shell and execline.

To setup vm services: 
	# useradd -d /var/empty -s /bin/false qemulog
	# install -o qemulog -d /var/log/vm/tapsrv
	# cp -r vm-use-finish /service/vm-foobar
	# install -o qemulog -d /var/log/vm/foobar
	# echo -n 'DD:EE:AA:DD:BB:EE' > /service/vm-foobar/env/MAC
	# echo -n '/path/to/disk.qcow2' > /service/vm-foobar/env/DISK
